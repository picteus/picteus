# Purpose

This extension runs a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on the same computer as Picteus. This MCP server allows a LLM
to interact with the Picteus API, hence offering a device to communicate with it via natural language.

# Parameters

The extension may be customized as far as the MCP server port number listens to. Open the extensions and customize its
port number, which is set to `3003` by default.
